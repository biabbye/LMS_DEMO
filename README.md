# LMS_DEMO

This is a demo of a LMS platform , or "Code-Screening" Platform, that allows teachers to add new assignments for students , and students to compile and test ( using a Python interpreter) and submit their solution. The database used for all the application's models is MongoDB. The solution is implemented using ReactJS, NodeJS,Express Bootstrap and MaterialUI for UI. The application has a role-based authentication system.

The solution is still in process.
